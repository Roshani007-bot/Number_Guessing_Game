# Number_Guessing_Game
This project is a simple and fun Java game where the user tries to guess a number generated by the computer. The game provides feedback to guide the user in guessing correctly and can be extended with additional features like limiting attempts, playing multiple rounds, and scoring based on the number of attempts.
